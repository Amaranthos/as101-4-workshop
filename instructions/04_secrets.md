# Exercise 4 - Handling secrets

## TODO

- do this with Ansible Vault or https://secrethub.io/,
- If enough time maybe do GH Actions

## 04-01 - Remove secrets in code

We will update our code to remove secrets in code and instead, use Ansible Vault to source them.

Follow the instructions in [handling-secrets.md](https://github.com/wilvk/sample-deploy-pipeline/blob/master/handling-secrets.md).
